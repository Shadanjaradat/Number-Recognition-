To use the matlab files, the dataset has to be in the same folder. Dataset is a file will all of the data for training and testing.
These files are coded to read specific datasets; alter path if using another dataset.

All files have to be used together as they are connected. kNN_classifier uses hu, central_moment, and center_of_mass. 
plotFeatures is not used in the main file but can be used to plot the 2D or 3D feature space. 


kNN_classifier implements three different processes; remove or comment out parts not desired to run.
In the final bit of kNN_classifier, an input test image is read to be tesed.
 Include image in same file path as matlab file and change its name in code.
