**Handwritten Numerical Recognition** 

This project investigates the use of machine vision to apply a numerical recognition system using MATLAB.

The projects explores the use of kNN classification methods and numerical extraction using MATLABs image processing tools. 


The technique used was feature extraction, use the seven Hu moments on each number for extraction and classification.


Feature selection is a very essential technique in data and image processing. By comparing different features to the data class given, images can be classified into their correct classes.


**Hu Moments**


1. Calculate the Density Distribution
2. Calculate the Centroid
3. Calculate Central Moment 
4. Calculate the Normalized Moment 
5. Normalization using log
